# Method Selection

Pyleet provides flexible method selection to handle solution classes with multiple methods. This is particularly useful when working on multiple LeetCode problems in a single file or when your solution class contains helper methods alongside the main solution methods.

### Automatic Method Selection (Default)

By default, Pyleet automatically selects the appropriate method using intelligent heuristics:

1. **Single method**: If only one method exists, it's used automatically
2. **Type-based matching**: Method names containing input type names are prioritized (e.g., `ListNode` input â†’ `processListNode` method)
3. **Fallback**: Uses the first available method if no type match is found

### Explicit Method Selection

Use the `--method` (or `-m`) parameter to specify exactly which method should be executed:

```bash
pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt --method methodName
```

### Example: Multiple Methods in One Solution Class

Consider a solution file with multiple LeetCode problems:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        # Implementation here
        pass

    def threeSum(self, nums):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

**Testing different methods:**

```bash
# Test the twoSum method specifically
pyleet solution.py --testcases two_sum_cases.json --method twoSum

# Test the threeSum method specifically
pyleet solution.py --testcases three_sum_cases.json --method threeSum
```

### When to Use Explicit Method Selection

- **Multiple problem solutions**: When your file contains solutions to different LeetCode problems
- **Method name ambiguity**: When automatic selection might choose the wrong method
- **Testing specific implementations**: When you have multiple approaches to the same problem
- **Helper methods present**: When your class contains both solution methods and helper methods

### Error Handling

If you specify a method that doesn't exist, Pyleet will provide helpful feedback:

```bash
$ pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt --method nonExistentMethod
Error: Method 'nonExistentMethod' not found. Available methods: ['twoSum', 'threeSum', 'maxSubArray']
```
