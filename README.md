Pyleet is a Python tool that allows you to **run and test your LeetCode Python solutions locally** with minimal modification. It bridges the gap between LeetCode's online environment and local development, making it easier to debug and verify your solutions offline.

---
## Features

- **Local Testing**: Run LeetCode Python solutions locally without modifying code.
- **Test Case Flexibility**: Support for `.txt` and `.json` test case files.
- **Intuitive CLI**: Run tests easily with commands like `pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt`.
- **Smart Method Detection**: Automatically selects methods based on input types or allows explicit selection with `--method`.
- **Built-in Data Structures**: Includes `ListNode` and `TreeNode` with automatic serialization, eliminating boilerplate code.
- **Customizable Execution**: Choose automatic fallback, explicit imports, or custom class overrides for flexible usage.
- **Broad Data Support**: Seamlessly handles lists, integers, strings, and custom classes with bidirectional serialization.
- **Clear Error Reporting**: Provides detailed feedback and comparison for accurate test results.
- **Debugging Support**: Displays `print()` output from solutions in test results for easier debugging.
- **Programmatic Interface**: Run tests directly from Python code with `pyleet.run()` for better integration.
- **Auto Test Case Retrieval**: Automatically fetch test cases from LeetCode. ([Learn more](https://github.com/ergs0204/pyleet/blob/main/docs/test_case_retrieval.md))

## Installation

### Using pip

```
pip install pyleet
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ergs0204/pyleet.git
cd pyleet
pip install -e .
```

---
## Quick Start

Run your LeetCode solution against a test case file using the CLI:

```bash
pyleet your_solution_file.py --testcases test_cases.txt
```

For example, if your solution is in `solution.py` and test cases in `cases.txt`:
```bash
pyleet solution.py -t cases.txt
```

Pyleet also supports programmatic usage. See the Detailed Documentation for more.

## CLI vs Programmatic Comparison

| Feature           | CLI Approach                     | Programmatic Approach           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Test Case Storage | External files (`.txt`, `.json`) | Python code                     |
| IDE Integration   | Limited                          | Full autocomplete/debugging     |
| Debugging         | Terminal only                    | IDE debugger integration        |
| Method Selection  | `--method` flag                  | `method` parameter              |
| Output            | Printed in terminal              | Captured in variables           |
| Automation        | CI / Shell scripts               | Python / Notebooks              |
| Best For          | Quick tests, CI/CD               | Development, notebooks, IDE use |

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use Programmatic Interface when:**
- Developing and debugging in an IDE
- Working in Jupyter notebooks
- Need tight integration with Python workflows
- Want to process test results programmatically
- Prefer keeping tests close to solution code

**Use CLI when:**
- Quick testing of solutions
- CI/CD pipelines
- Sharing test cases with others
- Working with large test suites in files

---

## How It Works

- Loads your solution file dynamically
- Loads and parses the test cases from the external file
- Converts inputs into Python data structures
- Calls your solution method with the inputs
- Compares the output to the expected result
- Reports pass/fail status for each test case
- Any `print()` output from your solution will be shown in test result, helping with step-by-step debugging

---

## Built-in and Custom Class Support

Pyleet supports both **built-in** and **custom** data structures commonly used in LeetCode problems, such as `ListNode`, `TreeNode`, or your own custom classes like `Point` or `Matrix`.

### Built-in Support for `ListNode` and `TreeNode`

Pyleet includes built-in `ListNode` and `TreeNode` classes that match LeetCode specifications.

#### Key Benefits

* ‚úÖ **Zero boilerplate** ‚Äì No need to copy-paste class definitions into your solution
* ‚úÖ **Flexible** ‚Äì Use built-in classes or override with your own if needed
* ‚úÖ **Standard compliant** ‚Äì Compatible with LeetCode's input/output formats
* ‚úÖ **Automatic serialization** ‚Äì Input/output conversion is handled seamlessly

---

### Custom Class Support

This section provides a brief overview. For full details, see the [Custom Classes Guide](https://github.com/ergs0204/pyleet/blob/main/docs/custom_classes_guide.md).

Pyleet allows full support for custom data types and complex class structures. You can:

* Define and register your own classes
* Create custom serializers and deserializers
* Use automatic or explicit method selection with type-based heuristics
* Build reusable and maintainable test cases using JSON-based formats
