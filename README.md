Pyleet is a Python tool that allows you to **run and test your LeetCode Python solutions locally** with minimal modification. It bridges the gap between LeetCode's online environment and local development, making it easier to debug and verify your solutions offline.

---

## Features

- Run LeetCode Python solutions locally without modifying your original code
- Provide test cases in a separate file (`.txt` or `.json`)
- Simple CLI command: `pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt`
- **üéØ Built-in ListNode and TreeNode classes** - No need to define common LeetCode classes yourself!
- **üîÑ Three usage patterns** - Automatic fallback, explicit import, or custom override
- **üß† Flexible method selection** - Automatic selection based on input types OR explicit method specification
- **‚ÜîÔ∏è Bidirectional serialization** - Both input deserialization and output serialization
- **üîß Enhanced custom class support** - Any class structure supported, no `val` attribute required
- Supports all common LeetCode data structures (lists, integers, strings, TreeNode, ListNode, and more)
- Easy installation via `pip` or `setup.py`
- Robust error handling and comparison strategies

## üöÄ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyleet.git
cd pyleet
pip install -e .

pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt
```
‚úÖ Done. Now your local LeetCode environment is ready.

---
## Installation

### Using pip (coming soon)
We'll update this section once Pyleet is available on PyPI.


### From source (development mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyleet.git
cd pyleet
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

Prepare your **LeetCode solution file** (e.g., `solution.py`) as you would submit it on LeetCode, without modification.

Prepare a **test case file** (e.g., `cases.txt`) containing your test inputs and expected outputs.

### Basic command

```bash
pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt
```

### Advanced usage with method selection

When your solution class contains multiple methods, you can specify which one to use:

```bash
# Automatic method selection (default behavior)
pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt

# Explicit method selection
pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt --method twoSum
pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt -m threeSum
```

### Example test case file format

#### Plain text format (initial version):

```
[1,2,3]
6

[4,5,6]
15
```

Each test case consists of:
- **Input arguments** (e.g., `[1,2,3]`)
- **Expected output** (e.g., `6`)
- Separated by a blank line

#### JSON format (recommended):

```json
[
  {
    "input": [[2, 7, 11, 15], 9],
    "expected": [0, 1]
  },
  {
    "input": [[3, 2, 4], 6],
    "expected": [1, 2]
  },
  {
    "input": [[3, 3], 6],
    "expected": [0, 1]
  }
]
```

**JSON format features:**
- **Structured data**: Each test case is a JSON object with `input` and `expected` fields
- **Multiple arguments**: Input can be a list of arguments: `"input": [arg1, arg2, arg3]`
- **Single argument**: For single arguments, wrap in a list: `"input": [arg1]`
- **Complex data types**: Supports nested structures, objects, and custom classes
- **Optional descriptions**: Add `"description"` field for test case documentation

**Advanced JSON example with TreeNode:**

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Invert binary tree - simple case",
    "input": [{"TreeNode": [4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 6, 9]}],
    "expected": {"TreeNode": [4, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1]}
  },
  {
    "description": "Single node tree",
    "input": [{"TreeNode": [1]}],
    "expected": {"TreeNode": [1]}
  }
]
```

## Built-in ListNode and TreeNode Classes

Pyleet includes built-in `ListNode` and `TreeNode` classes for common LeetCode data structures. For detailed information about using these classes and custom class support, please see the [Custom Classes Guide](docs/custom_classes_guide.md).

### Key Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Zero boilerplate** - No need to copy-paste class definitions
- ‚úÖ **Flexible** - Use built-in classes or define your own
- ‚úÖ **Standard compliant** - Built-in classes match LeetCode specifications
- ‚úÖ **Automatic serialization** - Input/output conversion handled automatically

---

## How It Works

- Loads your solution file dynamically
- Loads and parses the test cases from the external file
- Converts inputs into Python data structures
- Calls your solution method with the inputs
- Compares the output to the expected result
- Reports pass/fail status for each test case

---

## Method Selection

Pyleet provides flexible method selection to handle solution classes with multiple methods. This is particularly useful when working on multiple LeetCode problems in a single file or when your solution class contains helper methods alongside the main solution methods.

### Automatic Method Selection (Default)

By default, Pyleet automatically selects the appropriate method using intelligent heuristics:

1. **Single method**: If only one method exists, it's used automatically
2. **Type-based matching**: Method names containing input type names are prioritized (e.g., `ListNode` input ‚Üí `processListNode` method)
3. **Fallback**: Uses the first available method if no type match is found

### Explicit Method Selection

Use the `--method` (or `-m`) parameter to specify exactly which method should be executed:

```bash
pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt --method methodName
```

### Example: Multiple Methods in One Solution Class

Consider a solution file with multiple LeetCode problems:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """LeetCode Problem 1: Two Sum"""
        # Implementation here
        pass

    def threeSum(self, nums):
        """LeetCode Problem 15: Three Sum"""
        # Implementation here
        pass

    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """LeetCode Problem 53: Maximum Subarray"""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

**Testing different methods:**

```bash
# Test the twoSum method specifically
pyleet solution.py --testcases two_sum_cases.json --method twoSum

# Test the threeSum method specifically
pyleet solution.py --testcases three_sum_cases.json --method threeSum
```

### When to Use Explicit Method Selection

- **Multiple problem solutions**: When your file contains solutions to different LeetCode problems
- **Method name ambiguity**: When automatic selection might choose the wrong method
- **Testing specific implementations**: When you have multiple approaches to the same problem
- **Helper methods present**: When your class contains both solution methods and helper methods

### Error Handling

If you specify a method that doesn't exist, Pyleet will provide helpful feedback:

```bash
$ pyleet solution.py --testcases cases.txt --method nonExistentMethod
Error: Method 'nonExistentMethod' not found. Available methods: ['twoSum', 'threeSum', 'maxSubArray']
```
